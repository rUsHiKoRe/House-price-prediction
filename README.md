House price prediction with decision tree and random forests algorithm
The csv file contains data about melbourne housing prices and features.
The project is about predicting the house prices using an algorithm called decision tree and random forest. I have applied different techniques to improve the performance of algorithm such as\
Data cleaning : Fill missing values\
Label Encoding : Used Convert categorical features into numerical values\ 
cross validation\
X-G Boost regressor\
Algorithms : Decision Tree, Random Forest
